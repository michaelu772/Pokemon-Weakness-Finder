# Pokemon-Weakness-Finder
A command line and GUI program that finds the most effective type moves against the Pok√©mon you search for.

Example usage of the command line program:

  Please enter one of the following:
	Enter the name of the Pokemon
	Enter the Pokedex entry number
	Enter 'custom' to input a custom typing
	Enter 'auto' to enter automatic mode
	Enter 's' to take a screenshot
	Enter 'q' to exit: 
  
 'auto' mode is by default set to:
 
  LEFT_X = 20
  LEFT_Y = 212
  X_OFFSET = 314
  Y_OFFSET = 75

These coordinates make a box around the opponents pokemons name. Please adjust accordingly if you want the auto functionality to work as designed.

'custom' allows you to enter a custom pokemon typing instead of the name. Great for pokemon hacks where the typing has been changed.
